# tdd7
Test driven development framework for Drupal7.

# Introduction
The TDD7 is a unit testing framework for Drupal 7. It is not used in the
production code, but instead to make writing unit tests much much easier and
faster. It's designed to work with PHPUnit and does not need to bootstrap
an entire database, such as happens when using the DrupalWebTestCase with the
simpletest framework.
